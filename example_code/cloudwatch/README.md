# CloudWatch code examples for the SDK for Python

## Overview

Shows how to use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to work with Amazon CloudWatch.

<!--custom.overview.start-->
<!--custom.overview.end-->

*CloudWatch provides a reliable, scalable, and flexible monitoring solution that you can start using within minutes.*

## ⚠ Important

* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege).
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

* [Put a set of data into a metric](cloudwatch_basics.py#L88) (`PutMetricData`)
* [Put data into a metric](cloudwatch_basics.py#L61) (`PutMetricData`)

### Scenarios

Code examples that show you how to accomplish a specific task by calling multiple
functions within the same service.

* [Manage metrics and alarms](cloudwatch_basics.py)

#### Manage metrics and alarms

This example shows you how to do the following:

* Create an alarm to watch a CloudWatch metric.
* Put data into a metric and trigger the alarm.
* Get data from the alarm.
* Delete the alarm.

<!--custom.scenario_prereqs.cloudwatch_Usage_MetricsAlarms.start-->
<!--custom.scenario_prereqs.cloudwatch_Usage_MetricsAlarms.end-->

Start the example by running the following at a command prompt:

```
python cloudwatch_basics.py
```

<!--custom.scenarios.cloudwatch_Usage_MetricsAlarms.start-->
<!--custom.scenarios.cloudwatch_Usage_MetricsAlarms.end-->

### Tests

⚠ Running tests might result in charges to your AWS account.


To find instructions for running these tests, see the [README](../../README.md#Tests)
in the `python` folder.
