*Organizations consolidates multiple AWS accounts into an organization that you create and centrally manage.*

## ⚠ Important

* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege).
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

<!--custom.prerequisites.end-->

### Single actions

Code excerpts that show you how to call individual service functions.

* [Attach a policy to a target](organizations_policies.py#L90) (`AttachPolicy`)
* [Create a policy](organizations_policies.py#L21) (`CreatePolicy`)
* [Delete a policy](organizations_policies.py#L129) (`DeletePolicy`)
* [Describe a policy](organizations_policies.py#L69) (`DescribePolicy`)

## Run the examples

### Instructions


<!--custom.instructions.start-->
Run this example at a command prompt with the following command.

```
python organizations_policies.py [--target TARGET]
``` 

The example optionally attaches and detaches the demo policy to an AWS Organizations
resource, such as a root organization or account. If you want to include this in the
demo, replace `TARGET` in the command with the ID of the resource.
