# Amazon SQS code examples for the SDK for Python

## Overview

Shows how to use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to work with Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS).

<!--custom.overview.start-->
<!--custom.overview.end-->

*Amazon SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that makes it easy to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.*

## ⚠ Important

* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege).
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Code examples

### Prerequisites

For prerequisites, see the [README](../../README.md#Prerequisites) in the `python` folder.

Install the packages required by these examples by running the following in a virtual environment:

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<!--custom.prerequisites.start-->
<!--custom.prerequisites.end-->

### Single actions

Code excerpts that show you how to call individual service functions.

* [Create a queue](queue_wrapper.py#L23) (`CreateQueue`)
* [Delete a batch of messages from a queue](message_wrapper.py#L143) (`DeleteMessageBatch`)
* [Delete a message from a queue](message_wrapper.py#L124) (`DeleteMessage`)
* [Delete a queue](queue_wrapper.py#L92) (`DeleteQueue`)
* [Get the URL of a queue](queue_wrapper.py#L51) (`GetQueueUrl`)
* [List queues](queue_wrapper.py#L70) (`ListQueues`)
* [Receive messages from a queue](message_wrapper.py#L94) (`ReceiveMessage`)
* [Send a batch of messages to a queue](message_wrapper.py#L51) (`SendMessageBatch`)
* [Send a message to a queue](message_wrapper.py#L24) (`SendMessage`)

### Scenarios

Code examples that show you how to accomplish a specific task by calling multiple
functions within the same service.

* [Send and receive batches of messages](message_wrapper.py) 

### Cross-service examples

Sample applications that work across multiple AWS services.

* [Create a messenger application](../../cross_service/stepfunctions_messenger) 
* [Create an Amazon Textract explorer application](../../cross_service/textract_explorer) 

## Run the examples

### Instructions

#### Send and receive batches of messages

This example shows you how to do the following:

* Create an Amazon SQS queue.
* Send batches of messages to the queue.
* Receive batches of messages from the queue.
* Delete batches of messages from the queue.

<!--custom.scenario_prereqs.sqs_Scenario_SendReceiveBatch.start-->
<!--custom.scenario_prereqs.sqs_Scenario_SendReceiveBatch.end-->

Start the example by running the following at a command prompt:

```
python message_wrapper.py
```

<!--custom.scenarios.sqs_Scenario_SendReceiveBatch.start-->
<!--custom.scenarios.sqs_Scenario_SendReceiveBatch.end-->

### Tests

⚠ Running tests might result in charges to your AWS account.


To find instructions for running these tests, see the [README](../../README.md#Tests)
in the `python` folder.
